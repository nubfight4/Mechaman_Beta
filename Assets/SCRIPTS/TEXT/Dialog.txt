Welcome to the training simulation system, rookies.
I will be teaching you amazing stuff about this Mecha. 
The orangey bars up there are health bars. 
Now, it's time for you two to learn some combat skills.  
Now movement pilot, go ahead and dance like a wild beast to show dominance.
*Movement pilot - Left Thumb Stick to move around*                
You make me proud, movement pilot! Now get some rest. Attacking pilot, it's your time to shine!
Try your best to fight against this extremely scary and vicious enemy.   
*Attacking pilot- Press     or     to attack the enemy*
*Attacking pilot   -   Press the       button three times to perform a combo attack*
Alright before you two leave, now both pilots try to work together and do some synchronized attacks.
* Movement pilot       while the Attacking pilot does a normal attack       at the same time! *
You guys can press the Start button to check the Movelist and pause the game.
One more thing before you go...
Notice the green bar below your health bar?
That's your special attack bar. Both of you can perform it by pressing LB and RB together.
But it's a little wonky right now, but I am pretty sure you can get it working once you walk out and do a little bit more Sync Attacks to warm it up.
And without further ado... 
Now off you go!
